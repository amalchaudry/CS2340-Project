Test Cases:


1. In test 1, TowersCostDifferently, we have created a test that ensures that the boat towers all cost different amounts that correspond with the difficulty of the game. For example, in the most difficult level of the game, the boat tower costs 1050 whereas in the easiest level it costs 950, which demonstrates the difference between difficulty in levels of the game as required in M3.
2. Test 2, DifferentTowersDifferentRange, examines the range of each of the different towers on the hardest difficulty level and ensures that they exhibit different ranges so that players can choose between various towers to maximize on different qualities like range or power, which demonstrates the necessity and variety of different towers in M3.
3. Test 3, DifferentTowersDifferentCoolDown, similar to test 2 tests the different cool down times between towers on the hardest difficulty level to compare a different quality- the cool down time and helps players understand the differences between the towers they choose, which also demonstrates the necessity and variety of different towers in M3.
4. Test 4, WhiteSpaceOnName, ensures that the name entered in the configuration screen is not a white space as required by the M2 requirements.
5. Test 5, DifferentLakeHP, ensures that the lake HP is different in every level of the game. It is the lowest in the hardest level and gets higher as the game gets easier, which meets the M3 requirements of differences between difficulty levels in the game. A lower HP level on the lake makes for a more difficult game as players can lose sooner and can make less mistakes when catching fish.
6. Test 6, DifferentMoney, ensures that the money is different in every level of the game. It is the lowest in the hardest level and gets higher as the game gets easier, which meets the M3 requirements of differences between difficulty levels in the game. Less money makes for a more difficult game as players can lose sooner and can purchase less towers at the beginning of the game. 
7. Test 7, AllSameDamage, ensures that the damage done to the towers on the lake are the same in a specified level of the game. Despite the differences between the ranges and cool downs of each tower, they are all meant to have the same damage done to them. It is the highest in the hardest level and gets lower as the game gets easier, which meets the M3 requirements of differences between difficulty levels in the game.
8. Test 8, GameInstantiatesPlayerObject, ensures that once a player makes it past the configuration and welcome pages, the game instantiates a new player object that allows them to play the game with money and LakeHP in their chosen difficulty level. This test chooses the highest difficulty, which meets the M3 requirements which necessitate multiple difficulty levels and the creation of player objects, a lake/background object, and money to buy towers.
9. Test 9, CannotPlaceTowerOutOfMap, ensures that the towers can only be placed within the bounds of the game screen. This meets the M3 requirements that towers must be placed in the game screen, not outside it.
10. Test 10, CanBuyTower, ensures that the player can purchase their chosen tower in both the medium and the hardest difficulty levels with the amount of money that they have. This meets the M3 requirements that towers can be purchased, but only if players have the means to buy them.
