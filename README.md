What is complete: 
The game implementation is complete. The player can start/end the game and go to the player section where they will input their name and their desired difficulty for the game. After, the player will be taken to the map with a side panel where they can view their starting funds, initial HP, and can place their towers down in the way they see fit. The towers can only be placed on land and not on the water. Then the players can press the "Start" button in which would activate the game. Tuna, Swordfish, and Salmon will have different speeds and come swimming through the map. The Boatman, Fisherman, and Spearman towers will attack the fish. During the game, the players will be able to upgrade their towers as well by pressing on a tower and selecting the button "Upgrade." The players will also be able to click on the fish and see their HPs. The game will end when the player's health goes to 0 or when the player defeats the Shark which appears after the 16th fish dies.
